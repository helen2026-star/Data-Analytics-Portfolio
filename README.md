# Internship Program Analysis

A short data analysis of an internship program to understand performance distribution, skill/team alignment, and recruiting signals. Includes findings, root-cause analysis for underperformance, and actionable recommendations.

## Summary of findings

Based on the analysis of 80 interns across three teams:

- **Performance distribution across teams:** Team A has the largest share of interns (~50%), followed by Team C (~31%) and Team B (~19%). Rating **4** is the most common final outcome (~45%), while Rating **5** is less frequent (~13.8%). Team A contributes the largest share of top performers. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Skill/team structure mismatch:** Teams A and B are Python-dominant (software development), while Team C is C++/infrastructure-focused. In Team C, interns with **Python + C++** perform best on interview score, match score, and final rating; Python-only interns perform worst on average. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Recruiting signal by school:** Interns from Harvard/Princeton/Stanford/Caltech/MIT show top average performance (>4) but with smaller counts; UIUC shows a strong balance of scale and performance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **Underperformance pattern:** 14 interns received final rating = 2, concentrated among **Python-only** interns with low team match scores; Team C cases suggest lack of C++ experience as a key driver. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Recommendations (from the deck)

1. Improve skill alignment (avoid Python-only placements on C++-heavy teams; offer short C++ onboarding if needed).
2. Define core technical prerequisites (Python + C++/systems exposure for complex teams).
3. Increase headcount from consistently high-performing schools (>4.0 average).
4. Tighten role-based screening with team-specific assessments.
5. Introduce role-specific intern tracks to reduce mismatch and underperformance.
6. Use broader performance metrics beyond a single final rating. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
